<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a PhD student in the [School of Microelectronics](https://sme.sustech.edu.cn/index/index/benyuan.html) department of [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). I obtained my BEng degree in Microelectronic Science and Engineering from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) in 2022, advised by [Prof. Fengwei An](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/anfw/en/). My research realm focuses on Stereo vision, computer architecture, low-power and high-performance VLSI circuit design and software-hardware co-design. You can find more information through my [CV](../images/ZhuoyuChen_CanadaCast_CV_.pdf). Welcome to contact with me if you have any interests.
